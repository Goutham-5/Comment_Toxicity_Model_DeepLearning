The Comment_Toxicity_Model_DeepLearning project is a deep learning-based application designed to assess the toxicity level of comments.
The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning model(LSTM) implemented in Python to detect toxic content in user-generated comments.
